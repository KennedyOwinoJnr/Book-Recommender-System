    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The current landscape of online libraries and book platforms lacks personalized recommendation systems that effectively cater to individual users' preferences and reading habits. Existing platforms often rely on generic recommendations or fail to leverage user data to deliver relevant book suggestions, leading to suboptimal user experiences and limited engagement. Our platform aims to address this challenge by developing a robust and intuitive recommendation system that harnesses user data, ratings, and book information to provide personalized book recommendations tailored to each user's unique profile. By seamlessly integrating user registration, profile creation, and recommendation display functionalities into the user interface, we seek to empower users to discover new books that align with their interests and preferences while fostering a vibrant and engaging community of readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "$i.$ Develop a personalized book recommendation engine that utilizes user data, ratings, and book information to generate tailored book suggestions for individual users based on their preferences, demographics, and reading history.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ii.$ **Create User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless user registration, profile creation, and recommendation display. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics Of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of our recommendation engine lies in delivering personalized content to every book lover on our platform, as reflected by high conversion rates of the content provided to users. While the industry standard for mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.5, we aim to surpass these expectations by developing a recommendation engine with a maximum MAE of 0.3. This commitment ensures that our engine consistently provides accurate and tailored book suggestions, exceeding industry benchmarks and enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.\n",
