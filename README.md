## Problem Statement

The current landscape of online libraries and book platforms lacks personalized recommendation systems that effectively cater to individual users' preferences and reading habits. Existing platforms often rely on generic recommendations or fail to leverage user data to deliver relevant book suggestions, leading to suboptimal user experiences and limited engagement. Our platform aims to address this challenge by developing a robust and intuitive recommendation system that harnesses user data, ratings, and book information to provide personalized book recommendations tailored to each user's unique profile. By seamlessly integrating user registration, profile creation, and recommendation display functionalities into the user interface, we seek to empower users to discover new books that align with their interests and preferences while fostering a vibrant and engaging community of readers.
